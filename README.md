# <span style="font-size:larger;">Land Cover Classification with Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors</span>

This repository contains Python code for land cover classification using machine learning algorithms like Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The aim is to classify different land cover types such as tree cover, shrubland, grassland, cropland, built-up areas, bare/sparse vegetation, snow and ice, and permanent water bodies based on satellite imagery data.

# <span style="font-size:larger;">Key features</span>
1. **Data Processing:** 
   The code preprocesses the data, removes unnecessary columns, and splits it into training and testing sets.

2. **Random Forest Classifier:** 
   Utilizes the Random Forest algorithm for classification, with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to optimize accuracy.

3. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** 
   Implements KNN for comparison, providing an alternative classification method.

4. **Evaluation Metrics:** 
   Computes accuracy scores, classification reports, and precision scores to evaluate model performance.

5. **Visualization:** 
   Utilizes Matplotlib for 3D visualization of hyperparameter tuning results.

# <span style="font-size:larger;">Results:</span>
The Random Forest classifier achieved an accuracy of 89.00%, while KNN achieved an accuracy of 87.089%. Detailed classification reports and hyperparameter tuning results are provided in the code output.
